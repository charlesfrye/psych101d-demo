    "# Lab1: Reviewing Jupyter Notebook and Python; Learning Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Pyschology 101D: Data Science for Psychology!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs are required. There are two ways to receive credit for each lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (The normal way) Come to your lab section and work on the lab as directed. Before you leave, you need to submit the lab **and** have a staff member check you off to confirm that you came to lab section and attempted to make progress while you were there. You do not need to finish the lab or answer every question correctly to receive full credit. However, you do need to try; that's why we check you off. Expect to discuss your progress briefly with a staff member before they will check you off.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. (The hard way) Lab assignments will be posted Monday night. If you complete the entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it by 11:59pm on Tuesday, then you don't need to physically attend lab for the rest of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",
    "\n",

    "In today's lab, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gain a better understanding (or even mastery) of Jupyter notebooks,\n",
    "2. refamiliarize yourself with Python,\n",
    "2. learn how to use the Pandas module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"

You know that double-clicking on markdown cells enables editing, while pressing `shift`+`enter` runs the current cell and selects the cell below. The purpose of this section is not to reteach how to use Jupyter notebooks, but rather help you achieve a potential mastery of Jupyer notebooks, if you choose to."

    "\n",

    "7. higlight line(s) `ctrl`+`/` toggle comment line(s)\n",
    "8. `esc` enter command mode\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command mode\n",
    "When you see a grey border with a left blue margin surrounding your cell, you are in command mode. Hotkeys in this mode enable you to quickly use notebook level commands such as inserting new cells, deleting cells, and changing the cell type along with many other features. Here are a some helpful examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `shift`+`enter` run current cell and select cell below\n",

    "8. `m` change cell type to markdown\n",
    "9. `enter` enter edit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "You should notice that some commands work in both modes. To access a full list of shortcuts, press `h` while in command mode. Alternatively, click on **Help** in the menu above and then **Keyboard Shortcuts**. `ctrl`+`shit`+`p` also works but it technically opens up the \"command pallete\" which allows you to search for Jupyter commands.\n",

Values that are not hashable, that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other mutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may not be used as keys. Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric comparison: if two numbers compare equal (such as 1 and 1.0) then they can be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry. (Note however, that since computers store floating-point numbers as approximations it is usually unwise to use them as dictionary keys.)\n",
