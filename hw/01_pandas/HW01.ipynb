    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text, section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",

For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ or `sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])`is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others (see \"How to Do Your Homework\" above) but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",

General usage looks like `frame.loc[rowname,colname]`. (Reminder that the colon `:` means \"everything\").  For example, if we want the `color` column of the `ex` data frame, we would use :\n",

    "- You can also slice across columns. For example, `baby_names.loc[:, 'Name':]` would give select the columns `Name` and the columns after.\n",

    "**Row Selection**\n",
